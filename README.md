# Water Quality

This project builds upon an analysis of a public health study conducted in rural Bangladesh (Gelman et al., 2004). The study examined arsenic contamination in drinking water wells and whether households switched wells. We measured several variables thought to influence well-switching decisions. Our goal is to predict household well-switching accurately based on these variables. The study collected data on arsenic levels (in hundreds of ùúág/L) in Araihazar, Bangladesh during 1999-2000. Additional information was obtained through a survey, including well-switching, distance to the nearest safe well, household involvement in community organizations, and highest education level. Arsenic contamination in drinking water is a global concern, affecting over 140 million people in 50 countries above the WHO guideline of 10 Œºg/L, with associated health risks (WHO, 2018a).
